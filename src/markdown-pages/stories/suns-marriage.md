*From my newsletter post, [Son, Sun](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/son-sun) on August 7, 2020.*

A long time ago, the Sun decided to marry the Moon, and invited all the animals to their wedding. The hedgehog however never showed up. The Sun went looking for him, and found him trying to chew on a stone. When the Sun asked why, the hedgehog said, “I must learn to eat stones, for once you marry, you will give birth to many Sun-children, and they will all shine in the sky, everything will burn, and we’ll have nothing to eat.”

The Sun thought about this for a moment, and decided to call off the wedding.
